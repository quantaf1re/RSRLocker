/**
 * This Basket contract is essentially just a data structure; it represents the tokens and weights
 * in some Reserve-backing basket, either proposed or accepted.
 *
 * @dev Each `weights` value is an integer, with unit aqToken/RSV. (That is, atto-quantum-Tokens
 * per RSV). If you prefer, you can think about this as if the weights value is itself an
 * 18-decimal fixed-point value with unit qToken/RSV. (It would be prettier if these were just
 * straightforwardly qTokens/RSV, but that introduces unacceptable rounding error in some of our
 * basket computations.)
 *
 * @dev For example, let's say we have the token USDX in the vault, and it's represented to 6
 * decimal places, and the RSV basket should include 3/10ths of a USDX for each RSV. Then the
 * corresponding basket weight will be represented as 3*(10**23), because:
 *
 * @dev 3*(10**23) aqToken/RSV == 0.3 Token/RSV * (10**6 qToken/Token) * (10**18 aqToken/qToken)
 *
 * @dev For further notes on units, see the header comment for Manager.sol.
