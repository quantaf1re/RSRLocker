/**
 * The Manager contract is the point of contact between the Reserve ecosystem and the
 * surrounding world. It manages the Issuance and Redemption of RSV, a decentralized stablecoin
 * backed by a basket of tokens.
 *
 * The Manager also implements a Proposal system to handle administration of changes to the
 * backing of RSV. Anyone can propose a change to the backing.  Once the `owner` approves the
 * proposal, then after a pre-determined delay the proposal is eligible for execution by
 * anyone. However, the funds to execute the proposal must come from the proposer.
 *
 * There are two different ways to propose changes to the backing of RSV:
 * - proposeSwap()
 * - proposeWeights()
 *
 * In both cases, tokens are exchanged with the Vault and a new RSV backing is set. You can
 * think of the first type of proposal as being useful when you don't want to rebalance the
 * Vault by exchanging absolute quantities of tokens; its downside is that you don't know
 * precisely what the resulting basket weights will be. The second type of proposal is more
 * useful when you want to fine-tune the Vault weights and accept the downside that it's
 * difficult to know what capital will be required when the proposal is executed.
 */

/* On "unit" comments:
 *
 * The units in use around weight computations are fiddly, and it's pretty annoying to get them
 * properly into the Solidity type system. So, there are many comments of the form "unit:
 * ...". Where such a comment is describing a field, method, or return parameter, the comment means
 * that the data in that place is to be interpreted to have that type. Many places also have
 * comments with more complicated expressions; that's manually working out the dimensional analysis
 * to ensure that the given expression has correct units.
 *
 * Some dimensions used in this analysis:
 * - 1 RSV: 1 Reserve
 * - 1 qRSV: 1 quantum of Reserve.
 *      (RSV & qRSV are convertible by .mul(10**reserve.decimals() qRSV/RSV))
 * - 1 qToken: 1 quantum of an external Token.
 * - 1 aqToken: 1 atto-quantum of an external Token.
 *      (qToken and aqToken are convertible by .mul(10**18 aqToken/qToken)
 * - 1 BPS: 1 Basis Point. Effectively dimensionless; convertible with .mul(10000 BPS).
 *
 * Note that we _never_ reason in units of Tokens or attoTokens.

     * These parameters are phyiscally a set of arrays because Solidity doesn't let you pass
     * around arrays of structs as parameters of transactions. Semantically, read these three
     * lists as a list of triples (token, amount, toVault), where:
     *
     * - token is the address of an ERC-20 token,
     * - amount is the amount of the token that the proposer says they will trade with the vault,
     * - toVault is the direction of that trade. If toVault is true, the proposer offers to send
     *   `amount` of `token` to the vault. If toVault is false, the proposer expects to receive
     *   `amount` of `token` from the vault.
     *
     * If and when this proposal is accepted and executed, then:
     *
     * 1. The Manager checks that the proposer has allowed adequate funds, for the proposed
     *    transfers from the proposer to the vault.
     * 2. The proposed set of token transfers occur between the Vault and the proposer.
     * 3. The Vault's basket weights are raised and lowered, based on these token transfers and the
     *    total supply of RSV **at the time when the proposal is executed**.
     *
     * Note that the set of token transfers will almost always be at very slightly lower volumes
     * than requested, due to the rounding error involved in (a) adjusting the weights at execution
     * time and (b) keeping the Vault fully collateralized. The contracts should never attempt to
     * trade at higher volumes than requested.
     *
     * The intended behavior of proposers is that they will make proposals that shift the Vault
     * composition towards some known target of Reserve's management while maintaining full
     * backing; the expected behavior of Reserve's management is to accept only such proposals,
     * excepting during dire emergencies.
     *
     * Note: This type of proposal does not reliably remove token addresses!
     * If you want to remove token addresses entirely, use proposeWeights.
     *
