/**
 * A Proposal represents a suggestion to change the backing for RSV.
 *
 * The lifecycle of a proposal:
 * 1. Creation
 * 2. Acceptance
 * 3. Completion
 *
 * A time can be set during acceptance to determine when completion is eligible.  A proposal can
 * also be cancelled before it is completed. If a proposal is cancelled, it can no longer become
 * Completed.
 *
 * This contract is intended to be used in one of two possible ways. Either:
 * - A target RSV basket is proposed, and quantities to be exchanged are deduced at the time of
 *   proposal execution.
 * - A specific quantity of tokens to be exchanged is proposed, and the resultant RSV basket is
 *   determined at the time of proposal execution.
